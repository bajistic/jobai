# Beta Requests Admin Interface

This component provides an administrative interface for managing beta access requests.

## Overview

The Beta Requests Admin interface allows authorized users to view, approve, or reject beta access requests submitted through the beta signup form. It fetches requests from the database and provides UI controls for managing their status.

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure

- Uses React hooks for state management and data fetching
- Cards to display each beta request
- Status badges to indicate current state (pending, approved, rejected)
- Action buttons for approving/rejecting requests

### Data Fetching

The component fetches data from:
- `/api/admin/beta-requests` (GET) to retrieve all beta requests
- Falls back to mock data for development if API fails

### Request Management

Status updates are handled by:
- Calling `/api/admin/beta-requests` (PUT) with the request ID and new status
- Optimistically updating the UI state
- Displaying toast notifications for success/failure

### Security

- Uses NextAuth session to verify the user is authenticated
- In production, should add role-based authorization to restrict to admins only

## Usage

### Accessing the Interface

Navigate to `/admin/beta-requests` while signed in as an administrator to access the interface.

### Workflow

1. View the list of pending beta requests
2. Review the information provided by the user
3. Click "Approve" to grant access or "Reject" to decline
4. The UI updates to reflect the new status
5. Changes are persisted to the database

### Response Handling

When approving a request:
- The request's status changes to "approved" in the database
- The UI updates to show the new status with a green badge
- A success toast notification appears

When rejecting a request:
- The request's status changes to "rejected" in the database
- The UI updates to show the new status with a red badge
- A success toast notification appears

## API Integration

The component interacts with:
- `GET /api/admin/beta-requests`: Fetches all beta requests
- `PUT /api/admin/beta-requests`: Updates a request's status

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements:
- Add filtering options (by status, date, etc.)
- Add search functionality
- Add pagination for large numbers of requests
- Add bulk actions (approve/reject multiple)
- Add notes/comments for rejected requests
- Add email integration to notify approved users
- Add analytics/metrics on approval rates
